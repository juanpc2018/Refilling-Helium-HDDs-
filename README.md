## Refilling Helium HDD's </p>

i have a "fake" Seagate Exos x20z 18TB hsmr st18000nm013j  </br>
those drives are cheap 2x18TB = 1x 22TB. </br>
the reason is that dont pass quality control, and dont have warranty,  </br>
for Storage are ok, Not for 24/7/365 Up time, for weekly/monthly backup only, </br>
most work ok. some are worse than others... you have to pray every time you use them. LOL.™ </br>
Some have high temps because Helium leaked or Not enough, less than <80%. some make weird noises sometimes. </br>
Datacenter trash is another's treasure. LOL.™

Refilling a 18TB HDD with Helium could be interesting. </br>
needs to be done in a sealed aquarium / vacuum chamber, BSL-4 lab type gloves, </p>
 
Helium reacts to Tesla coil, has a different color vs. oxygen & Nitrogen </br> 
easy to see, chamber must be vertical to separate heavier oxygen & Nitrogen. </br>
There are Medical Air concentrators, that have an Oxygen molecular filter, </br>
removes/stops/filters out Nitrogen and larger particles. </p>

before opening/drilling the HDD, </br>
the chamber must be vacuum suck to near 0 PSI, to remove any dust.
If HDD has leaks, or weak spots, the Vacuum will increase the size of the Leak.</p>

problem is placing a valve, or drilling a hole inside the chamber, </br>
a cordless drill </br>
also sealing / soldering again the hole.  </br>
that means the chamber must be big.</p>

then when camber is vacuum empty,  </br>
can be filled with Helium.  </br>
Helium pressure inside the chamber must be monitored. </br>
when finished, refilling the HDD, </br>
Helium inside the chamber must be recollected again to a scuba or paintball tank, aluminum or fiber glass,
with a vacuum pump connected to the chamber. </p>

chamber needs a lot of valves, and vacuum pumps, for oxygen and Helium,
also an Air concentrator filter loop, Hepa Filter loop </br>
to have a Clean Room like Intel and others, 1 part per million dust? </br>
Could Work. </p>

what is the "Normal" Temp. of a 18TB Helium sealed HDD? </br>
what is the "Normal" Helium pressure inside the HDD? </p>
